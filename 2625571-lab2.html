                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <h4>Monte Carlo Simulation for Predicting Corners</h4>
                <p>
                    This project utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the number of corners in soccer matches based on team specific attacking and defensive metrics. By analyzing historical data,
                    including possession percentages, shots on target, expected goals, and defensive tendecies, the model generates probability distributions for expected corners. The simulation runs thousands
                    of iterations to account for varience and provides insights into likely outcomes, helping with pre-match betting decision. The project intergrates statistical modelling with real world
                     factors like weather conditions and team form to improve accuracy, offeringa data-driven approach to sports analytics.
